1-4 Entities. Implement support for the less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) entities. These should be printed as < and >, respectively. For example, if the HTML response was &lt;div&gt;, the show method of your browser should print <div>. Entities allow web pages to include these special characters without the browser interpreting them as tags.

1-6 Keep-alive. Implement Exercise 1-1; however, do not send the Connection: close header. Instead, when reading the body from the socket, only read as many bytes as given in the Content-Length header and donâ€™t close the socket afterward. Instead, save the socket, and if another request is made to the same socket reuse the same socket instead of creating a new one. This will speed up repeated requests to the same server, which is common.
